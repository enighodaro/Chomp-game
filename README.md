The Game of Chomp
Chomp is a game invented by the late mathematician and economist David Gale.

Two players begin with a rectangular bar of chocolate, itself composed of smaller squares. They take it in turns to snap off - and eat - a lump of chocolate. However the top-left square has been replaced with a piece of soap. The loser is the person who has to eat the soap.

Each turn a player must choose a square then remove and eat it, along with all the squares that lie below and to the right of it.
