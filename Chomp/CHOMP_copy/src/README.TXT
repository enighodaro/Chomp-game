Chomp is a game where two players begin with a rectangular bar of chocolate, itself composed of smaller squares. 
They take it in turns to snap off - and eat - a lump of chocolate. However the top-left square has been replaced with a piece of soap. 
The loser is the person who has to eat the soap.

Each turn a player must choose a square then remove and eat it, along with all the squares that lie below and to the right of it.
